## About Us

PhantomByte Entertainment is dedicated to producing games and Unity software with a focus on creativity, quality, collaboration, and respect. Our organization thrives on pushing the boundaries of storytelling, particularly delving into psychological situations. We utilize music and other artistic elements to enhance the player experience and convey our messages effectively. While our main focus is psychological storytelling, we also develop games on various other topics.
